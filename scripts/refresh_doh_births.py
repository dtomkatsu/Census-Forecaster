"""Re-scrape Hawaiʻi DOH preliminary births and print the RxKids constants.

Source: Hawaiʻi Department of Health, Office of Health Status Monitoring,
"Preliminary Vital Statistics" — https://health.hawaii.gov/vitalstatistics/
One page per year, each carrying a *Month of Occurrence* table (births,
deaths, marriages) for Statewide plus each of the four counties.

Why this exists
---------------
``forecast_rxkids_2028.py`` pins the DOH snapshot in-code
(``HI_DOH_BIRTHS_MONTHLY``, ``DOH_COUNTY_SHARE``, ``DOH_SNAPSHOT``) so runs stay
byte-reproducible — the same discipline the anchor bundles follow. Pinning is
right, but hand-transcribing nine years × twelve months × five geographies on
each refresh is not. This script does the scrape and emits paste-ready literals,
so refreshing is one command plus one paste rather than an error-prone retype.

It deliberately does NOT write to the forecast script. The constants are a
reviewed input, and a silent auto-rewrite would defeat the point of pinning.

Usage
-----
    python scripts/refresh_doh_births.py
    python scripts/refresh_doh_births.py --json      # machine-readable dump

After pasting, in ``forecast_rxkids_2028.py``:

* bump ``DOH_SNAPSHOT`` to the "As of" date the script reports;
* DELETE any year NVSR has since finalised from ``HI_DOH_BIRTHS_MONTHLY``
  (NVSR always wins — ``_doh_nowcast_births`` skips years already in
  ``HI_BIRTHS_BY_YEAR``, so a stale duplicate is inert but misleading);
* re-run the RxKids forecast and the test suite.

Note on the county shares
-------------------------
This script does NOT produce ``NVSR_COUNTY_SHARE``. DOH counts by county of
*occurrence*; the model needs county of *residence*, and in Hawaiʻi the two
differ materially at county level even though they nearly coincide statewide —
neighbour-island mothers routinely deliver on Oʻahu, so occurrence overstates
Honolulu by ~2.2pp. The county shares come from CDC WONDER (dataset D66,
Hawaiʻi, grouped by county × year), which is residence-based and the same
source as the state anchor.

The DOH county totals ARE printed below, as an occurrence-basis cross-check:
they should sum to the statewide row in every year, and their divergence from
the WONDER residence shares should stay in the ~2pp range documented at
``NVSR_COUNTY_SHARE``. A sudden change there means one of the two sources
shifted definition and both should be re-examined.
