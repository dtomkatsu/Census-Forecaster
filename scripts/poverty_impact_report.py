"""Hawaii anti-poverty impact of EITC, CTC, and HI state EITC by geography.

Emits four CSVs per run at state, county, House district, and Senate
district granularity, comparing baseline SPM poverty rates against
seven counterfactuals (four removal, three expansion/new-credit).

    by_state.csv             — single-row state totals
    by_county.csv            — 4 Hawaii counties
    by_house_district.csv    — up to 51 HD rows
    by_senate_district.csv   — up to 25 SD rows

Scenarios:
  Removal — what would poverty look like without each credit?
    no_eitc, no_ctc, no_hi_eitc, no_credits
  Expansion — how much additional poverty reduction from policy changes?
    expanded_ctc_2021 (ARPA-style fully-refundable CTC),
    hi_eitc_100pct    (HI state EITC raised from 40% → 100% of federal),
    hi_ctc_300        (new HI state CTC at $300/qualifying-child, refundable),
    hi_ctc_650        (the SB 3125 CD1 amount, $650/qualifying-child),
    hi_ctc_1000       (high-end HI state CTC at $1000/qualifying-child)

Examples
--------
    # TY 2024 baseline + all seven scenarios on real PUMS, with SNAP
    python scripts/poverty_impact_report.py --tax-year 2024 --apply-snap \\
        --pums-data-dir packages/data/raw/pums \\
        --out reports/poverty_impact_2024/

    # TY 2025 projection
    python scripts/poverty_impact_report.py --tax-year 2025 --apply-snap \\
        --pums-data-dir packages/data/raw/pums \\
        --out reports/poverty_impact_2025/

    # The default scenario set already runs hi_ctc_300, hi_ctc_650, and
    # hi_ctc_1000 side-by-side. To run only a subset:
    python scripts/poverty_impact_report.py --tax-year 2024 --apply-snap \\
        --scenarios hi_ctc_1000 \\
        --out reports/poverty_impact_2024_hi_ctc_1000/

Notes
-----
* SNAP imputation is recommended for poverty-impact runs (without it,
  low-income units' SPM resources are understated by ~$500M/yr in
  Hawaii, biasing baseline poverty rates upward).
* See the module-level docstring of ``tax_modeler.poverty.impact`` for
  the full list of methodological caveats (static counterfactual,
  marginal-attribution non-additivity, unit-of-analysis bias).

# Advocacy narrative — Hawaiʻi Appleseed register
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# After each scenario's numeric line, ``_print_summary`` emits a 2–3 sentence
# narrative in the published Hawaiʻi Appleseed voice (see hiappleseed.org —
# "Helping Hawaiʻi's Families" and "A Fairer Tax Code for a Thriving
# Hawaiʻi"). Vocabulary anchors absorbed from those publications:
#
#   * Aspirational frame: families "deserve to thrive without worrying
#     whether they'll be able to make ends meet."
#   * Action verbs: "lift up", "lift out of poverty", "keep above the
#     line."
#   * Working-family centering: "ʻohana balancing two or three jobs to
#     meet the highest cost of living in the country."
#   * Hawaiian-language signifiers for human dignity: keiki, ʻohana,
#     kūpuna — used where they naturally fit, not decoratively.
#   * Macro-to-household bridge: connect dollar figures to lived
#     experience (housed vs. unhoused, debt, educational mobility).
#
# Narratives are original to this codebase — no sentence is copied
# verbatim from any Appleseed publication. The register is matched, not
# the wording. CSV outputs are unaffected; this is stdout polish only.
