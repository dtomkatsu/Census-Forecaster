"""Smoke tests for SPM resource calculation + Hawaii thresholds (Phase 2).

Validates that:

* ``compute_spm_resources`` runs on a taxed-units fixture, returns a
  populated column, and the meta records the expected zeroed components.
* The Hawaii threshold lookup is monotone in household size and within
  a sane range (between $20K and $100K for typical compositions).
* Resources < threshold can be combined with poverty metrics on the
  fixture without crashing — end-to-end Phase-2 smoke.
