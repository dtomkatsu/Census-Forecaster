"""Stage 3 smoke: enrich_for_credits derives credit-ready columns.

The enrichment step replaces the dependent person-ID list with synthetic
dependent dicts and derives ``earned_income``, ``investment_income``,
``total_cash_income``, ``num_qualifying_children``.  Without these,
downstream EITC/CTC math silently zeros out.
