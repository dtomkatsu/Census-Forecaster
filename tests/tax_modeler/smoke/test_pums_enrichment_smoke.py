"""Smoke tests for richer ACS/PUMS variable incorporation (Phase 7).

Validates that:

* ``enrich_for_benefits`` populates the expected per-tax-unit columns
  from person + household frames.
* SSI now picks up disabled people in addition to age-65+.
* ACA PTC properly excludes Medicaid- and Medicare-covered units.
* Childcare uses WKHP for work tests instead of the earned-income proxy.
* SPM thresholds vary by tenure when ``tenure`` column is present.
* ``EntityGraph.spm_units()`` produces P60-280-style groupings using
  RELSHIPP / AGEP from the person frame.
