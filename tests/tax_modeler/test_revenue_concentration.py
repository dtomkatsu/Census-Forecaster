"""Phase E/F — DOTAX-calibrated income concentration model tests.

Tests for :mod:`tax_modeler.projection.revenue_concentration`.

Design
------
All tests are self-contained: no API calls, no DOTAX SOI CSV files required.
The module uses hardcoded calibrated representative incomes derived from
DOTAX Table 12A 2022 data (from ``DotaxTable12AValidator``).

Test organisation
-----------------
1. ``TestBracketData`` — validate the hardcoded DOTAX bracket entries.
2. ``TestExpectedRevenuePerFiler`` — core estimation function.
3. ``TestConcentrationMultiplier`` — calibration and economic properties.
4. ``TestTopQuintileFraction`` — revenue concentration tracking.
5. ``TestMakeConcentrationAdjustedFn`` — drop-in callable construction.
6. ``TestBracketCreepEffect`` — bracket creep as income grows.
7. ``TestB19082Interface`` — top_income_scale parameter for B19082 integration.
8. ``TestRevenueBacktestIntegration`` — concentration-adjusted fn in backtest.
9. ``TestConcentrationMarginalFn`` — effective marginal / delta-method helper.
