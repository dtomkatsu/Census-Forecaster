"""Tests for the ml_features module.

Coverage:
* PanelIndex builds correctly from a synthetic series_by_key.
* FeatureSpec column ordering is deterministic (panel order, target excluded).
* Population one-hot classifier matches strata.classify_pop.
* Training-row generator respects walk-forward cutoff.
* Missing data is encoded as NaN (HGB handles natively).
* Inference row builder rejects when anchor or anchor-1 are missing.
