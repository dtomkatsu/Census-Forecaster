"""Regression guard: macro_monthly.json writers must MERGE, never replace.

Six scripts contribute series to one shared file (market_panel,
national_macro, eia_hawaii, dbedt_mei, hta_visitors, ui_claims,
hawaii_indicators). refresh_market_panel runs FIRST in the CI workflow,
so if its write replaces the file, every later script re-adds only its
own series — and anything whose fetch failed that run is deleted from
committed history rather than merely going stale.

That happened on 2026-08-06: transient FRED timeouts dropped
MORTGAGE30US and DGS10 from the committed bundle, which silently
removed three 2020-robust rate->home-value findings from the causal
screen. These tests pin the merge semantics so it cannot recur.
