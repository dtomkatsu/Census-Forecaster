"""The sign check: does a pass move the way its mechanism predicts?

A Granger F-test is direction-blind. On 2026-08-07 US_JETFUEL →
HI_VISITORS cleared BH at all three lags while moving OPPOSITE to its
written mechanism — a "pass" that was never evidence for the claim. The
check exists so that class of error is caught automatically.

Two implementation bugs were hit while building it and are pinned here,
because both made the check actively harmful rather than merely weak:
scoring the direction at the peak-|r| lead (a seasonal echo at lead 12
outvoted the real signal at lead 3, accusing the best-verified finding
in the screen), and having no materiality floor (a mean r of +0.009
reported as "contradicting", burying real violations in noise).
