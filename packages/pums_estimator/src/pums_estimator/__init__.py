"""pums-estimator: county-level distribution estimation via PUMS microdata reweighting.

Estimates statistics not directly published by the Census Bureau — such as
the distribution of vehicle types by county — by reweighting ACS PUMS
microdata to match county-level control totals from census_forecaster.

Quick start
-----------
    >>> from pums_estimator import (
    ...     PumsRecord, CountyControls, SyntheticEstimatePoint,
    ...     fetch_pums, load_crosswalk, estimate_county_distribution,
    ...     controls_from_acs_table, scale_margins,
    ... )

Statistical contract
--------------------
Results are *model-based estimates*, not direct survey estimates.  They
carry the uncertainty of both the PUMS sampling design and the raking
assumptions.  Do not treat them as equivalent to published ACS tables.
