"""Methodology-agnostic poverty metrics.

These functions accept ``(resources, threshold, weights)`` and produce
the canonical poverty headcount, depth, and gap statistics. They serve
both OPM and SPM analyses — the difference is what you put into
``resources`` (pre-tax money income vs. post-tax-and-transfer SPM
resources) and ``threshold`` (OPM dollar thresholds vs. SPM
geographically-adjusted thresholds).

A "poverty unit" can be a household, family, SPMUnit, or tax unit
depending on the methodology. The functions don't care; they just count
units below the threshold weighted by the supplied population weights.
