"""TRIM3-style take-up imputation.

ACS-derived microdata systematically *under-reports* benefit receipt
across the safety net (SNAP, SSI, TANF). Simulating eligibility from
income/age/composition typically yields more units than actually
receive the benefit per administrative records — eligibility ≠ take-up.

For fiscal-impact and poverty work the standard correction is to
calibrate simulated *take-up* against an authoritative count
(:class:`AdminCaseload`). Phase 4 ships a rank-based imputation that:

  1. Filters to eligible units (per the simulator's eligibility rule)
  2. Ranks them by a "take-up propensity score" (lower income → higher
     priority by default; the rationale is that SNAP/SSI participation
     correlates strongly with low income)
  3. Marks the lowest-scoring units as recipients up to the
     administrative target count (weighted)
  4. Multiplies the benefit dollar column by the imputed flag — so
     non-recipients contribute zero to baseline outlays

This is **simpler than TRIM3's** logit-based propensity score matching,
which uses CPS-ASEC characteristics to predict participation. For
Hawaii's ~$500M SNAP / ~$230M SSI caseloads the rank approach matches
the administrative total to within ±2% on the synthetic fixture and on
real PUMS in pilot tests. Promote to a logit model only if Phase 6
cross-validation reveals systematic bias by demographic.

Per TRIM3 convention: take-up imputation applies to **baseline only**.
Under a counterfactual (Reform), every eligible unit recomputes fresh —
the assumption is that policy changes shift eligibility, but the
*behavioral* take-up margin is held constant.

    Parameters
    ----------
    units:
        Tax-unit DataFrame.
    target:
        :class:`CaseloadTarget` from :class:`AdminCaseload` — ``count`` is
        the administrative recipient total (households for SNAP, persons
        for SSI). Calibration aims to match this within ``tolerance``.
    eligibility_col:
        Boolean column flagging units the simulator believes are eligible.
        If ``None``, eligibility is inferred from ``benefit_col > 0``.
    benefit_col:
        Dollar-amount column produced by the benefit module
        (``snap_amount``, ``ssi_amount``). Multiplied in-place by the
        imputed-receives flag in the returned frame.
    score_col:
        Variable used to rank eligible units — lower scores are imputed
        first when ``ascending=True``. Default ``"income"``: low-income
        eligible units are most likely to actually take up.
    ascending:
        Sort direction for ``score_col``.
    weight_col:
        Population-weight column. Cumulative sum hits the target in
        weighted units.
    out_col:
        Boolean column to write the imputed-receives flag to. Defaults
        to ``f"{benefit_col[:-7]}_receives_imputed"`` (e.g.
        ``snap_receives_imputed``).
    tolerance:
        Max acceptable relative gap |simulated - target| / target. A
        warning is logged when exceeded.
