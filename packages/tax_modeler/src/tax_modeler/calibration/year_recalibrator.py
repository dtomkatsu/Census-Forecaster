"""ITEP-style year-by-year IRS target matching for projected tax units.

Wraps the existing projection pipeline (county B19013 growth + top-income
premium) with optional year-forward re-anchoring to Hawaii Council on Revenues
aggregate revenue and DOTAX-shaped bracket distribution. Closes the
methodology gap with ITEP, which re-anchors each projected year to IRS/CBO
income totals rather than relying on a single growth rate.

Usage
-----
::

    from tax_modeler.calibration.year_recalibrator import project_and_recalibrate
    projected, forward = project_and_recalibrate(
        units, target_year=2027, use_forward_targets=True,
    )

When ``use_forward_targets=False`` (default) the function is identical to
the legacy chain ``project_tax_units_forward(...) →
apply_top_income_growth_premium(...)``, preserving backward compatibility.

Order of operations (when re-anchoring is enabled)
-------------------------------------------------
1. ``project_tax_units_forward`` — county B19013 growth (unchanged).
2. ``forward_targets.build_targets`` — construct year-Y bracket targets.
3. ``phase1_reweight`` — re-rake weights to forward filer-count targets, so
   the top-bracket *population* matches IRS empirical patterns BEFORE the
   premium scales the AGI of those filers.
4. ``apply_top_income_growth_premium`` — existing premium (unchanged).
5. Tax recompute — caller is responsible for re-running ``_compute_base_tax``
   *if* they need fresh ``hi_tax_liability`` after the premium. The current
   premium implementation does not auto-recompute tax.
6. ``phase2_tax_calibrate`` — re-anchor aggregate Hawaii tax to the COR
   projection for year Y by applying per-bracket tax multipliers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    units:
        Calibrated base tax units (post-synthesis, post-CG-imputation,
        post-base-tax-compute). Must have ``income``, ``filing_status``,
        ``weight``, ``hi_tax_liability`` columns.
    target_year:
        The tax year to project to (e.g. 2027).
    use_forward_targets:
        When True, layers year-forward IRS-style re-anchoring on top of the
        county growth + top-premium projection. When False (default), the
        function is identical to the legacy chain (no behavioural change).
    apply_top_premium:
        Whether to apply ``apply_top_income_growth_premium`` (default True).
        Set False to project on county growth alone.
    top_premium_pct:
        Annual premium for filers ≥ ``top_premium_threshold``. Default 1.0%.
    top_premium_base_year:
        Base year for premium compounding. Default 2024 (most recent ACS).
    top_premium_threshold:
        Minimum AGI for the premium to apply. Default $500K.
    use_soi_anchor:
        When True, replace the Pareto-derived $1M+ resynthesis with a
        direct anchor on national IRS SOI Table 1.4 tiers. Mutually
        exclusive with ``resynthesize_top`` — if both are True,
        ``use_soi_anchor`` wins. Requires ``use_forward_targets=True``.
    soi_year:
        SOI Table 1.4 vintage to anchor on (default 2022, the most recent
        published).
    hawaii_capgain_adjustment:
        Multiplier on national SOI CG share for Hawaii residents
        (default 0.95, matching DOTAX Table 21 evidence).
    use_cbo_aging:
        When True, replace ``project_tax_units_forward``'s uniform
        county-median aging with per-component CBO Outlook aging
        (different growth for wages, CG, business, etc.). Phase 1 rake +
        SOI top anchor + Phase 2 calibration still run downstream.
    cbo_vintage:
        CBO Outlook publication identifier (default ``"2025-01"``).
    cbo_hawaii_factors:
        Per-component Hawaii calibration multipliers on CBO national
        rates. None → use ``cbo_aging.DEFAULT_HAWAII_FACTORS`` (HI wage
        growth ~0.85 of national, CG parity).
    cor_projections_M, top_bracket_differential, low_growth, rate_drift:
        Forwarded to ``forward_targets.build_targets`` when
        ``use_forward_targets`` is True.
    method:
        Projection method passed to ``project_tax_units_forward``
        (``"ensemble"`` by default).
    base_year:
        Optional ACS anchor year for ``project_tax_units_forward``. Pass
        ``None`` to use the projector's default (most recent ACS vintage).

    Returns
    -------
    (projected_df, forward_targets)
        ``forward_targets`` is the ``ForwardTargets`` used for re-anchoring,
        or ``None`` when ``use_forward_targets=False``.
