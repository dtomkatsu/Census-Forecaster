"""Biproportional raking of tax-unit weights to IRS SOI district targets.

Currently the within-PUMA assignment of House/Senate districts uses a
deterministic ``SERIALNO`` hash (see :mod:`puma_imputation` /
:mod:`district_imputation`). Each district inside a PUMA gets a uniform
slice of the PUMA's filers — district-level estimates carry roughly
±20% uncertainty because the actual distribution of filers across
districts depends on within-PUMA demographics that the hash ignores.

Biproportional iterative proportional fitting (IPF) raises district
estimates to actual marginal totals while keeping the PUMA marginals
unchanged. Concretely, given:

  * a ``weight`` column on the input tax-unit frame
  * IRS SOI ZIP filer counts mapped to House districts
  * the existing ``PUMA`` and ``house_district`` columns

the algorithm rescales weights so that, simultaneously:

  * ``sum(weight)`` per ``house_district`` matches the IRS target
  * ``sum(weight)`` per ``PUMA`` stays at its pre-raking value (the
    ACS-anchored marginal we trust)
  * the state total ``sum(weight)`` is preserved by construction

Standard biproportional IPF converges in ~20-30 iterations on small
2-D problems. Tolerance: ``max |w_pre - w_post| / state_total < 1e-6``.

Data sources (the script-side wrapper expects bundled paths):

  * IRS SOI ZIP-code data for Hawaii TY2022, columns ``ZIPCODE``,
    ``N1`` (filer count). Source: irs.gov/statistics/soi-tax-stats-
    individual-income-tax-statistics-zip-code-data-soi.
  * ZIP → House district crosswalk. Sourced either from the Hawaii
    Legislature precinct-to-ZIP mapping or built from ArcGIS Hawaii
    district shapefiles + HUD USPS ZIP centroid file. Bundled as
    ``data/crosswalks/hawaii_zip_to_house_district.csv``.

The IRS SOI ZIP data + ZIP→HD crosswalk for Hawaii are **not bundled
with this Tier-2 ship**. When the bundle lands, the high-level wrapper
``rake_weights_to_irs_zip`` will load them automatically. Until then,
the wrapper raises :class:`MissingDataError` with a clear pointer when
``--rake-to-irs-zip`` is set without the data on disk, and users can
call :func:`rake_biproportional` directly with explicit targets.
