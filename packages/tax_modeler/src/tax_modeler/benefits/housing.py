"""Federal housing assistance (Section 8 vouchers + public housing).

HUD-funded programs administered in Hawaii by Hawaii Public Housing
Authority (HPHA) and several local PHAs. The two main vehicles:

  * **Housing Choice Voucher (HCV / Section 8)** — household pays 30%
    of adjusted AGI in rent; HUD pays the difference up to a
    locally-set "payment standard" (~Fair Market Rent).
  * **Public Housing** — same 30%-of-AGI rent rule applied to publicly-
    owned units.

For fiscal-impact purposes we model both as a single in-kind transfer:

    benefit = max(0, FMR − 0.30 × AGI)

where FMR is HUD's Fair Market Rent for Hawaii (2024 Honolulu MSA
2-bedroom: ~$2,500/month = $30,000/year).

Income eligibility: 50% AMI for "very low income" (the standard HCV
threshold). HUD Hawaii Area Median Income tables are the production
source; we approximate via FPL since AMI tracks regional median income
and HHS Hawaii FPL captures the Hawaii cost-of-living adjustment.

Phase 5 simplifications:

  * Single FMR used statewide (Honolulu MSA 2BR). Real PHAs set
    payment standards by ZIP and bedroom count; Phase 5 doesn't
    differentiate.
  * Voucher waitlists are not modeled — Phase 4 take-up imputation
    against the HUD CHAS database calibrates the receiving headcount.
  * "Adjusted AGI" approximated as ``income`` (the deductions HUD
    allows — dependents, elderly, etc. — would shave a few percentage
    points off the rent calculation).

Reform DSL (``Reform.benefit_overrides["housing"]``):

  * ``payment_standard_pct``     multiplier on FMR (default 1.0)
  * ``income_threshold_factor``   multiplier on 50% AMI / FPL proxy
  * ``tenant_rent_pct``          tenant rent share of AGI (default 0.30)
