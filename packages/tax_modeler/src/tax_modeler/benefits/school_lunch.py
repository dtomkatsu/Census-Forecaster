"""NSLP (National School Lunch Program) — free / reduced-price school meals.

Census SPM Technical Documentation §4.3.1 specifies that the cash-equivalent
value of free and reduced-price school meals is counted as an SPM resource.
The value is computed as::

    annual_value = USDA per-meal reimbursement × school days × eligible_children

Eligibility:

  * Free meals:      household income ≤ 130% FPL (or categorical eligibility
                     via SNAP / TANF / Medicaid in CEP states; Hawaii has
                     a number of CEP schools)
  * Reduced price:   household income 131-185% FPL (≤ 185% FPL inclusive)

Hawaii operates on a separate USDA reimbursement schedule (higher than the
contiguous-US rate under 42 U.S.C. §1759a). For FY2022 the Hawaii free-meal
federal reimbursement rate was $4.21/meal; reduced-price was $3.81/meal.

The model here imputes per-tax-unit annual value from filing-unit income +
dependent count, with a flat 180-day school year (HI DOE standard).

Implementation notes:

  * Dependents are counted as "children" — slight overcount for college-age
    dependents (~5% over) but conservative for SPM-targeting accuracy.
  * No school-day participation rate adjustment — Census uses a "usually
    eats at school" CPS ASEC question; we assume eligible kids participate
    in school lunch (CPS take-up rate for free-eligible kids is ~95%).
  * The amount is added to SPM resources (gross-up positive), mirroring
    how SNAP / housing / LIHEAP are treated.

Reform DSL (``Reform.benefit_overrides["school_lunch"]``):

  * ``free_reimbursement_pct``         multiplier on per-meal free rate
  * ``reduced_reimbursement_pct``      multiplier on per-meal reduced rate
  * ``school_days``                    school-year length (default 180)
  * ``income_threshold_factor``        multiplier on the eligibility ratios
