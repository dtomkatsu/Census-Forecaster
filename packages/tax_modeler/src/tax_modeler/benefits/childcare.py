"""Hawaii Child Care Subsidy Program (CCSP / former First-to-Work).

Administered by HI DHS Benefit, Employment and Support Services
Division. Subsidizes child-care costs for low-income working families,
families in education/training, and families participating in TANF.
Income limit: 85% of State Median Income (SMI), roughly equivalent to
~250% FPL for a family of 3 in Hawaii. Subsidies are paid directly to
licensed providers; parent contributes a sliding-scale co-payment.

Phase 5 simplifications:

  * Eligibility: working/in-training proxied by ``earned_income > 0``
    AND has children under age proxy. Without per-person ages, we
    approximate "children under 13" by ``num_dependents`` (slight
    overcount for older dependents; Phase 4 take-up imputation against
    the CCSP caseload corrects).
  * Per-child subsidy: ~$8,000/year (HI 2024 average, weighted across
    age groups and provider types).
  * Parent co-payment: sliding scale 0%-15% of income above 25% SMI.
    Net household subsidy = gross subsidy − co-payment.

Reform DSL (``Reform.benefit_overrides["childcare"]``):

  * ``per_child_subsidy_pct``    multiplier on annual per-child subsidy
  * ``income_threshold_factor``   multiplier on income cap
