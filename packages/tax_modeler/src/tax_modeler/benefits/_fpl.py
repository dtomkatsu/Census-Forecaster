"""Hawaii Federal Poverty Level (FPL) guidelines.

HHS publishes annual poverty guidelines separately for the contiguous
48 states + DC, Alaska, and Hawaii. Hawaii is ~11-12% above contiguous
US. The tables below are the published HHS guidelines (Federal Register).
Years HHS has not yet published are projected forward off the latest
published table using a documented CPI-U inflator (see
``_FPL_PROJECTION_INFLATOR``). Update annually when HHS publishes a new
table — promote the projected year to a real ``_HI_FPL_BASE_<year>`` table.

Used by SNAP gross/net income tests (Phase 3, separate USDA tables),
Medicaid eligibility (Phase 5), WIC eligibility (Phase 5), ACA Premium
Tax Credit (Phase 5), and the hypothetical RxKids program (300% FPL
eligibility test).
