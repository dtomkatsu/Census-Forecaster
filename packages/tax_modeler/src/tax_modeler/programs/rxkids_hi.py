"""RxKids Hawaiʻi — modeled prenatal + infant cash prescription program.

Hawaii-equivalent of the RxKids program operating in Flint MI and 35+
other Michigan communities (administered by Michigan State University +
GiveDirectly, launched Jan 2024). RxKids provides unrestricted cash
"prescribed" during pregnancy and the postnatal period, structured as
charitable disbursement (not taxable income, no SNAP/Medicaid offset).

This module evaluates a Hawaii-targeted variant adapted to local cost
of living and Hawaii's existing Medicaid (QUEST Integration) eligibility
framework. The default parameters model the **statutory** eligibility:
a unit qualifies if it satisfies EITHER of two clauses (see "Eligibility"
below). This is a substantially broader gate than a Medicaid-only design
and sits between the Medicaid-targeted (~$8-15M) and fully-universal
(~$110M) cost poles described in RXKIDS_METHODOLOGY.md.

Program scope
-------------

Eligibility (statutory — clause 1 OR clause 2)
    * **Clause 1 — Medicaid.** Any unit whose member qualifies for
      benefits under the State's Medicaid (Med-QUEST) program. Reuses the
      ``medicaid_receives`` boolean from
      ``tax_modeler.benefits.compute_medicaid_for_units``; the caller
      pre-attaches that column. For the prenatal arm, the pregnant-women
      pathway (``pregnant_fpl_cap``, 196% FPL) is also honored. (If the
      flag is absent the module falls back to clause 2 only and warns.)
    * **Clause 2 — 300% FPL.** Family income ≤ 300% FPL for a family of
      applicable size *including the expected unborn child*. The income
      test runs at family size; a birth's family includes the child either
      way (the unborn child pre-birth equals the newborn dependent in the
      cross-section), so one family-size test serves both arms.

Both arms are driven by the same **birth events** — ``num_dependents ×
child_under_age_share`` (the annual birth-rate per dependent). A first
birth appears as the newborn dependent in the PUMS cross-section, so this
captures first AND repeat births across ALL filing statuses (married
couples included), not just a single/HoH-no-dependent proxy. Each eligible
birth draws one prenatal and one postnatal payment.

Payment structure (defaults below; override for alternative designs)
    * Prenatal: ``prenatal_monthly`` × ``prenatal_months``
      (default $1,500 × 1 = $1,500 per pregnancy)
    * Postnatal: ``postnatal_monthly_per_child`` × ``n_children`` ×
      ``postnatal_months`` (default $500/mo × eligible kids × 6 = $3,000)
    * Take-up: ``takeup_rate`` (default 0.90; Flint observed 0.98 under
      universal design + hospital partnership — Hawaii models 0.90 in
      absence of analogous infrastructure)

Tax treatment
    * ``is_taxable = False`` (default). Flint program is structured as
      charitable disbursement (GiveDirectly), so payments do not flow
      through AGI / EITC / CTC interactions. Modeled by adding the
      ``rxkids_amount`` column to SPM resources only — NOT to
      ``total_cash_income``. See ``compute_spm_resources`` wiring.

Outputs
    * ``rxkids_amount`` — combined expected annual benefit per unit.
    * ``rxkids_prenatal_amount`` / ``rxkids_postnatal_amount`` — the two
      arm subtotals, for splitting program outlay in the cost report.

Universal variant (advocacy framing)
    Override the defaults to model the Flint universal program:
        params = RxKidsHIParams(
            prenatal_monthly=2000.0,    # one-time $2,000 (use
                                        # prenatal_months=1 to model
                                        # as one-shot)
            prenatal_months=1,
            postnatal_monthly_per_child=500.0,
            income_fpl_cap=10.0,        # effectively universal
            takeup_rate=0.95,
        )

Caveats
-------
* PUMS does not observe pregnancy or individual child ages → both arms are
  probabilistic, driven by ``child_under_age_share`` (default 0.066 =
  Hawaii annual births ÷ dependents 0-17), the annual birth FLOW per
  dependent. Population totals are reliable; per-unit amounts are
  expectations, not literal payments. Sensitivity: linear in this share.
* The Flint RxKids program is universal (no income/Medicaid test). The
  default parameters here model a Medicaid-eligibility-gated variant
  for cost reasons. Override ``income_fpl_cap`` to a high value to
  model the universal variant.
* Modeled as non-taxable charitable cash. If the Hawaii legislature
  structured a similar program differently (e.g. as a refundable tax
  credit), the resource-accounting treatment would need to change.

Reform DSL hooks (``Reform.benefit_overrides["rxkids"]``)
    * ``prenatal_monthly``                $-per-payment override (one-time)
    * ``prenatal_months``                 number of prenatal payments (1 = one-time)
    * ``postnatal_monthly_per_child``     $-per-month-per-child override
    * ``postnatal_months``                number of postnatal monthly payments
    * ``income_fpl_cap``                  FPL multiplier override (10.0 = universal)
    * ``takeup_rate``                     take-up rate override

      income_fpl_cap`` (default 3.00), tested at family size. A birth's
      family includes the child either way, so one family-size test serves
      both arms. ``tax_year`` selects the FPL table.
