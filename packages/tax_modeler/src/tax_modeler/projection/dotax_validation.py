"""Validate the income-growth path against DOTAX monthly collections.

The model's Hawaiʻi nominal income growth (`_hawaii_nominal_growth`,
ACS-forecast × CPI) drives the SB 3125 revenue baseline. DOTAX monthly
collections are the cash-basis outcome side of the same economy:

* ``ind_wh``  — individual withholding on wages: the most direct monthly
  wage-income observation that exists, BUT it conflates wage growth with
  withholding-rate policy — the Act 46 (2024) bracket cuts phase in from
  TY2025 and mechanically depress it. Interpret gaps vs the model as
  *wages + policy*, not wages alone.
* ``ge_use`` / ``ge_allocated`` — General Excise & Use: rate-stable
  (4% + county surcharges), so the cleanest pure-activity gauge, at the
  cost of measuring gross receipts rather than household income.
* ``tat`` — transient accommodations: the tourism channel.

Read-only diagnostics; nothing feeds the forecast. Bundle refreshed by
``python -m census_forecaster.scripts.refresh_dotax_collections`` (the
bundle is an accumulating archive — collec XLSX files fall off DOTAX's
site after roughly a fiscal year).

Because collections are deposit-month cash (deadline spikes, filing
season), all comparisons here are same-window year-over-year sums —
never single months, never trailing windows that straddle unequal
seasonal shapes.
