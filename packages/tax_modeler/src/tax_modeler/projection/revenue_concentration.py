"""DOTAX-calibrated income concentration model for revenue projection (Phase E).

Why the single-point estimate is systematically low
------------------------------------------------------
Phase D's ``hawaii_tax_weighted(median_income)`` is a point estimate: it
applies the tax function at exactly the median income level.  Because the tax
function is *convex* (progressive marginal rates), Jensen's inequality gives::

    E[tax(Y)]  >  tax(E[Y])  ≥  tax(median(Y))

The gap is driven by the right tail of the income distribution.  Hawaii's
income tax is extremely concentrated:

  * Top 28% of filers (AGI ≥ $75k) → **81% of revenue** (DOTAX Table 12A 2022)
  * Top 1.4% of filers (AGI ≥ $400k) → **33% of revenue** alone

A median-only forecast misses this entirely.  A 5% income growth year that is
driven by capital gains at the top generates far more revenue than 5% growth
in median wages — and vice versa for a recession that clips high earners first.

How this model works
---------------------
1. **DOTAX 2022 bracket distribution** (from ``DotaxTable12AValidator``) gives
   12 AGI brackets with their return counts and average tax-before-credits.
2. For each bracket, a **representative income** is the gross income level at
   which ``hawaii_tax_weighted(income)`` equals the DOTAX bracket average.
   This inversion simultaneously captures:

   * The actual income distribution within each bracket (skewed toward the
     lower bound — most filers are near $75k in the $75k–$100k bracket, not $87.5k)
   * Itemized deduction heterogeneity (high earners itemize; their taxable
     income is lower than AGI implies)
   * Filing-status mix within each bracket

   The 12 representative incomes were calibrated once with ``scipy.optimize.brentq``
   against the 2022 DOTAX data and are hardcoded below.

3. **Projection**: scale each bracket's representative income by the income
   growth factor ``g = projected_median / base_median``.  Optionally, supply
   a separate ``top_income_scale`` for the high-income brackets (from projected
   B19082_005E top-quintile share) to model divergence between median and top
   income growth.

4. **Expected revenue**: apply the tax function to each scaled representative
   income, weight by return counts, sum.

Verification: at ``growth=1.0``, the model reproduces the DOTAX 2022 average
of $4,770/filer within 0.004% (no hyperparameter tuning; purely structural).

B19082 integration
-------------------
When B19082_005E (top quintile income share) is projected:

    top_income_scale = projected_top_quintile_share / base_top_quintile_share

Pass ``top_income_scale`` to scale the high-income brackets independently.
Within ``expected_revenue_per_filer``, top brackets are scaled by
``base_growth × top_income_scale``, giving total top-bracket growth equal
to ``(proj_share / base_share) × (proj_median / base_median)`` — the
product of the share shift and the median growth, which is the correct
expression for absolute top-quintile income growth.  This models the
empirically common case where top-income growth diverges from median income
growth (technology booms, capital gains events, out-migration, etc.).

Usage
------
::

    from tax_modeler.projection.revenue_concentration import (
        expected_revenue_per_filer,
        concentration_multiplier,
        TOP_QUINTILE_REVENUE_SHARE_2022,
    )

    # Per-filer average revenue for a year where median income grew to $90k:
    rev = expected_revenue_per_filer(projected_median_income=90_000)
    # → more accurate than hawaii_tax_weighted(90_000) because it weights
    #   the full income distribution, not just the median

    # Revenue amplification from the concentration effect:
    mult = concentration_multiplier(90_000)
    # → ratio E[tax(Y)] / tax(median), always ≥ 1 for progressive tax

    # With B19082 projection (top-quintile income growing faster):
    rev_high_tail = expected_revenue_per_filer(90_000, top_income_scale=1.08)
    # → scales the top-income brackets by 8% more than median

    At Hawaii's 2022 income distribution, this ratio is approximately
