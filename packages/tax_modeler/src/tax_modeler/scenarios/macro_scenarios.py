"""Macro scenario income shocks for SB 3125 CD1 recession analysis.

Shocks are multiplicative adjustments applied AFTER project_tax_units_forward()
and apply_top_income_growth_premium(), and BEFORE behavioral response.

IMPORTANT: Shock values represent CUMULATIVE DEVIATIONS from the baseline
trajectory at each point in time — NOT year-on-year deltas. So a value of
−0.015 for 2028 means "income is 1.5% below the baseline trajectory in 2028,"
representing a depressed level after partial recovery from a deeper 2027 trough.

This matters because each year's `project_tax_units_forward()` call returns
income at the BASELINE trajectory for that year (independent of any prior
shocks). To model a recession with persistent effects, each year's shock must
encode the cumulative gap to baseline, not the year-on-year change.

Usage in forecast loop:
    projected = project_tax_units_forward(units, target_year=year)
    projected = apply_top_income_growth_premium(projected, ...)
    if macro_shock is not None:
        projected = apply_macro_recession_shock(projected, target_year=year,
                                                scenario=macro_shock)
    # ... rest of behavioral chain unchanged

NOTE: Update SB3125_CD1_FORECAST.md whenever these parameters change.

    """Apply a macro recession income shock to projected tax units.

    Applies a base shock to ALL filers (cumulative deviation from baseline)
    plus an additional top-income shock for filers above the income threshold
    (capturing capital-gains and business-income cyclicality).

    The shock values represent CUMULATIVE deviations from the baseline
    trajectory at each year — not year-on-year changes. This correctly models
    persistent recession effects: by year 2 income is still depressed (smaller
    gap to baseline), not "rebounded above baseline."

    Call AFTER project_tax_units_forward() and apply_top_income_growth_premium(),
    BEFORE apply_behavioral_response(). Returns a modified copy; does not mutate
    the input DataFrame.

    Args:
        df:          Projected tax units for the target year (income at baseline).
        target_year: The tax year being modeled (2027–2031).
        scenario:    Key into MACRO_SCENARIOS dict (currently only "moderate").
        income_col:  Income column to scale (default "income").

    Returns:
        Modified DataFrame with income scaled to the recession-adjusted level.
        For "moderate" recession in 2031 (full recovery), this is a no-op copy.

    Example:
        >>> # 2027 trough: all filers 2% below baseline; top filers 3.5% below
        >>> projected = apply_macro_recession_shock(projected, target_year=2027)
        # All filers: income × 0.980
        # Filers ≥ $200K: income × 0.980 × 0.985  (total: × 0.9653)
        >>> # 2028 partial recovery: all 1.5% below; top 2.5% below
        >>> projected = apply_macro_recession_shock(projected, target_year=2028)
        # All filers: income × 0.985
