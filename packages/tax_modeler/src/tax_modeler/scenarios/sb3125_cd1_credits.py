"""Static-scoring overlay for SB 3125 CD1 credit changes.

Three credit changes in the bill have material fiscal impact but are not
captured by the individual-income-tax microsimulation:

  1. §235-12.5 Renewable Energy Technologies Income Tax Credit
     - Capped at $40M aggregate per year for TY 2027-2030
     - Set to $0 from TY 2031 onward
     - Adds AGI eligibility limits ($175K single/HoH/MFS, $350K MFJ)
       Per §235-12.5(a) as amended: "$175,000 if filing as an individual,
       or $350,000 if filing jointly". HoH and MFS treated as "individual"
       (single category) per user direction.

  2. §235-110.7 Capital Goods Excise Tax Credit
     - Sunsets effective Dec 31, 2027 (applies TY 2028+)

  3. §235-110.91 Tax Credit for Research Activities (via Act 261 amendment)
     - Bill accelerates Part II of Act 261 from 1/1/2030 to 1/1/2029
     - Net effect: credit eliminated 1 year earlier (TY 2029 instead of 2030)
     - Bill impact = TY 2029 only; TY 2030+ baseline already has it sunset

DOTAX TY2023 baselines (in $M, from "Tax Credits Claimed by Hawai`i
Taxpayers — Tax Year 2023", Dec 2025):

  Renewable Energy Tax Credit (Table A-1, line 1854; A-5, line 2067):
    Total: $100.1M
    By taxpayer type:
      Individuals:   $58.3M  (subject to AGI limit)
      Corporations:  $38.6M  (NOT subject to AGI limit)
      Other (other):  $3.2M  (financial corp, fiduciaries, exempt orgs)
    Individual claims by AGI bin:
      <$10K:      $4.7M  (100% eligible — below threshold)
      $10-30K:    $2.5M  (100% eligible)
      $30-60K:    $3.1M  (100% eligible)
      $60-100K:   $5.8M  (100% eligible)
      $100-200K: $16.2M  (~97.2% eligible per PUMS — most below $175K)
      $200K+:    $26.0M  (~56.1% eligible per PUMS — MFJ at $200-350K still in)
    Eligibility shares derived from Hawaii calibrated tax units (cached at
    /tmp/tax_units_cache.parquet, weighted-filer counts).

  Capital Goods Excise Tax Credit (Table A-1, line 1862):
    Total: $34.6M

  Tax Credit for Research Activities (Table A-1, line 1857):
    Total: $7.0M  ($1.0M individuals + $6.0M corporations)

Growth assumption: Hawaii nominal income growth from
``get_hawaii_real_growth_factor(2023, year) * cpi_honolulu_factor``,
matching the methodology used for tax unit projections.

This overlay does NOT model:
  - Behavioral response to the cap (pro-rata allocation under §235-12.5(h)
    means filers have minimal incentive to time claims — appropriate to
    treat as static)
  - Carryover dynamics (carry-forwards from prior years post-cap)
  - Non-individual REEC claimants other than corporate (~$3.2M "other"
    treated as not subject to AGI limits but counted in cap)

    Applies Hawaii nominal income growth and OBBBA demand-decay factors
    for the chosen scenario. Individual / residential claims grow with
    median income and decay per the §25D-termination scenarios;
    corporate / commercial claims grow with Hawaii business-sector
    nominal output and use the §48E-extension factor (no decay through

    Parameters
    ----------
    effective_claim_share : float
        **Nonrefundable utilization rate** — the share of nonrefundable
        REEC claims that actually offset current-year tax (the rest
        carry forward or expire). Refundable claims always offset 100%.
        The aggregate effective share is computed per pool from the
        DOTAX 2023 refundable / nonrefundable split: individual REEC is
        ~23% refundable, corporate REEC is ~89% refundable, so a 0.80
        nonrefundable utilization rate yields ~85% effective for
        individual and ~98% effective for corporate. Default 1.0 makes
        the function backward-compatible (no utilization haircut).
    corp_subject_to_agi_limit : bool
        Whether corporate REEC claims are subject to the AGI limit. The
        bill text in §235-12.5(a) says "the taxpayer's adjusted gross
        income does not exceed $175,000 if filing as an individual, or
        $350,000 if filing jointly." Whether "AGI" applies coherently to
        a corporation is contested. Default False (treat corp claims as
        eligible regardless of AGI). Set True for a conservative scenario
        — assumes corporations get treated like high-income individuals
        and most ($200K+ bin = 56.1% eligible) claims are accepted.

        simulation that tracks nonrefundable stock from TY2010 onward and
        applies §235-12.5(j) "until exhausted" carryforward dynamics.
        Bill scenario: AGI filter from TY2027, $40M cap on TY2027-2029
        certifications, sunset for TY2030+ vintages. Baseline scenario:
        no filter, no cap. Reported savings = baseline state cost −
        scenario state cost, where state cost = refundable + nonref-stock
        usage in target_year. Pre-2027 stock drawdown is identical in
        both scenarios and cancels; the differential captures (a) ineligible
        demand permanently lost in cap years and (b) reduced future
        drawdown from capped vintages. Default False (legacy behavior).

    Returns a dict with the breakdown described in the module docstring.
