"""Behavioral response module for SB 3125 CD1's new 13% top bracket.

Static-scoring forecasts overstate the revenue gain from a top-bracket rate
hike because high earners respond on multiple margins:

  1. **Taxable-income elasticity (ETI)** — They shift compensation
     (deferred comp, fringe benefits), realize fewer capital gains
     ("lock-in"), restructure pass-through income, and shelter via
     deductions / charitable giving. Standard ETI for top earners
     ranges 0.20-0.50 (Saez/Slemrod/Giertz 2012; Hawaii has limited
     state-level evidence).

  2. **Migration / domicile change** — They move to states with lower
     or no income tax. Hawaii has the worst net out-migration of high
     earners in the country (IRS SOI migration data). Young & Varner
     (2011) estimate top-1% migration elasticity ≈ 0.10-0.15 per
     percentage-point top-rate increase, with effects concentrated
     among the very highest earners and growing over time.

  3. **Pass-through entity (PTE) election** — Hawaii's PTE election
     under HRS §235-110.93 lets pass-through businesses pay Hawaii
     tax at the entity level (currently 11%, the top individual
     rate) and SALT-deduct it federally. SB 3125 CD1's 13% individual
     rate creates a 2pp incentive to shift income through PTE. Most
     S-corps and partnerships with $1M+ owners would elect.

This module applies these three responses on top of the static
microsimulation. They reduce the bracket-revenue estimate by an amount
that scales with: (a) the size of the marginal rate change, (b) the
income above the new threshold, and (c) the chosen elasticity values.

Three scenarios bracket the literature:
    LOW       — eti=0.15, migration_elast=0.05, pte_capture=0.20  (modest)
    MID       — eti=0.25, migration_elast=0.10, pte_capture=0.35  (default)
    HIGH      — eti=0.40, migration_elast=0.15, pte_capture=0.50  (aggressive)

         entity-level election under HRS §235-110.93.
      2. Even where K-1 capital gains could theoretically be elected,
         the Hawaii CG cap (7.25%, HRS §235-16) is *below* the PTE rate
         (9%), so rational filers would not elect PTE for CG income —
         it would raise their tax on that income.

    The microsim's tax calculator applies the *standard deduction* to

    than the calculator estimates. To compensate, we subtract the

    above the bill's threshold, so that downstream tax computation
    arrives at a reasonable taxable income.
