"""Top-income (1M+) synthesis wrapper for the SB3125 CD1 fiscal-impact pipeline.

PUMS samples ultra-high-income filers very thinly: the calibrated tax units
recover only ~19% of the DOTAX $1M+ filer count (342 weighted vs the 1,824
target from DOTAX TY2023 data, IRS SOI 2022 Table A8). The IPF rake's
1.5x weight-cap prevents it from closing this gap on its own (a 5x
adjustment would be needed).

This module wraps :class:`UltraHighIncomeSynthesizerV2` to:
  1. Add Pareto-distributed synthetic $1M+ filers across realistic
     filing-status mix (MFJ 69% / Single 22% / HoH 5% / MFS 4% per
     DOTAX Table A8 $400K+ data).
  2. Use TOTAL income (incl. capital gains) as ``agi`` rather than
     ordinary-only, since Hawaii taxes CG at ordinary rates and the
     rest of this pipeline treats ``agi`` as total AGI.
  3. Assign synthetic rows to Honolulu county/PUMA (where ultra-high
     earners are concentrated) so projection-stage county growth
     factors apply correctly.
  4. Map synthetic columns to match the pipeline's tax-unit schema
     so downstream stages (tax recompute, projection, RevenueEstimator)
     consume them transparently.

The synthesizer should be inserted AFTER IPF calibration but BEFORE
projection, so the rake doesn't see (and try to undo) the synthetic
rows. After synthesis, the base tax must be re-computed so the
synthetic rows have proper ``hi_tax_liability`` values.

DOTAX target source: "Tax Credits Claimed by Hawai`i Taxpayers — Tax
Year 2023" combined with IRS SOI 2022 Hawaii Table A8 (1,824 filers
generating $663M Hawaii state tax above $1M AGI).

    This closes the gap between Pareto-distribution-derived income levels and
    the DOTAX/IRS SOI tax benchmark.  The Pareto synthesizer hits the filer
    count target exactly but typically recovers only ~88% of the $663M tax
    target because the conditional-mean income per tier underestimates the
    very top of the tail.  A uniform income scale factor ``k`` applied to all
    synthetic filer incomes corrects this.

    At $1M+ income Hawaii's effective marginal rate is approximately flat at
    11% (top bracket), so ``tax ≈ k × income × rate`` — a single-pass k
    lands within ~0.5% of target after ``_compute_base_tax()`` reruns. No
