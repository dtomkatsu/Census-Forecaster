"""Hawaiʻi Appleseed brand palette — single source for branded deliverables.

These hex values were duplicated verbatim (under two different naming
conventions) in the poverty-impact brief and the poverty dashboard. Both
now import from here, so a brand-guide change is a one-line edit.

Applies to Appleseed-branded outputs only. The other deliverables keep
their own deliberate design languages and must NOT be folded in here:

  - ``tax_modeler.reporting.quintile_pdf`` — navy/blue legislative
    distributional reports
  - ``generate_reec_report.py`` — blue-tinted REEC deliverable
  - ``generate_itep_report.py`` — ITEP-comparable HTML (also runs on
    system python3 with no library imports, so it cannot import this)
