ARPA 2021 Expanded Child Tax Credit (counterfactual / what-if module).

Computes the federal CTC under the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) 2021
expansion (IRC §24(i), one-year-only, in effect for TY 2021). Used as a
counterfactual scenario for the poverty-impact module: what would the
CTC look like if ARPA had been extended into the current tax year?

ARPA 2021 design (vs. TCJA baseline):
  * Max credit per child: $3,600 (under 6) / $3,000 (age 6-17)
    — TCJA baseline is $2,000/child.
  * Age limit raised from under-17 to under-18.
  * Fully refundable (no $1,500/$1,600/$1,700 ACTC cap, no $2,500
    earned-income floor).
  * Two-tier phase-out:
      - The "bonus" amount (max minus $2,000 base) phases out at
        5%/dollar above $75k single / $112.5k HoH / $150k MFJ, down
        to $0 (cannot reduce the $2,000 base).
      - The $2,000/child base then phases out per the standard TCJA
        rules at $200k single / $400k MFJ.

LIMITATIONS (intentional v1 approximations):

1. **Dependent ages**: the upstream pipeline synthesizes every dependent
   as age 10 in :func:`tax_modeler.pipeline.enrich_for_credits` (the
   PUMS person→tax-unit map preserves the dependent count but loses
   age detail). For the ARPA tier split we therefore use a Hawaii-wide
   under-6 fraction (33.4%, derived from 2022 ACS under-18
   population) and assign the **expected** per-child max:

        expected_max_per_child = 0.334 × $3,600 + 0.666 × $3,000 ≈ $3,200

   Precision better than this requires re-imputing dependent ages from
   PUMS persons; see ``CBO_COMPONENT_AGING_SCOPE.md`` for that scope.

2. **Phase-out scope**: applied to filing-status-derived MAGI proxy
   (``total_cash_income`` from ``enrich_for_credits``). Modified AGI
   under ARPA includes the same components as standard CTC MAGI
   (essentially AGI for non-international filers), so this is fine for
   the Hawaii population.

3. **Age-18 children**: ARPA raised the age limit to under-18 (so 17
   year-olds qualified), adding ~6% to the qualifying-child population
   on average. With age-uniform synthesized dependents at age 10, we
   don't capture this directly — instead the population scales up via
   the multiplier ``_ARPA_QUALIFYING_AGE_INFLATION = 1.06``. Same
   limitation as (1): tighter with re-imputed ages.
