"""Hawaii Supplemental Poverty Measure thresholds.

Real SPM thresholds are published annually by Census in the P60 SPM
series and are *geographically adjusted* via a metropolitan-area
housing-cost index. Hawaii (Honolulu MSA) sits well above the contiguous-
US baseline — historically ~14-18% higher for renters.

This module ships an approximate lookup table for the most recent
publication years and a function that interpolates by household
composition. Replace the table with a CSV import (and read it via
``state_config.HAWAII.spm_thresholds_csv``) when production-grade
analysis is needed; the API contract here will not change.

Sources to verify against when promoting Phase 2 to production:
- US Census Bureau, "The Supplemental Poverty Measure" (P60-280 series)
- Census API ``acs/acs1/subject`` table S1701 cross-referenced with
  metropolitan-area FMR adjustment factors.
