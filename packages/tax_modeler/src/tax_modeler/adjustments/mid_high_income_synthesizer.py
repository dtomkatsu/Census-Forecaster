"""Mid-High-Income Income Redistribution ($500K-$1M)

PUMS topcodes person income at the state-specific 99.5 percentile and replaces
above-topcode values with the median above the threshold. For Hawaii this
compresses $500K-$1M filers near $500K-$600K, leaving HB 2306 surcharge
revenue understated (the surcharge depends on income above $225K/$337.5K/$450K
thresholds, which scales with income beyond the bracket floor).

This module redistributes existing PUMS filers' incomes within $500K-$1M
to match a truncated Pareto distribution (alpha~1.5 anchored at $500K, capped
just below $1M to avoid double-counting with the $1M+ synthesizer). It does
NOT add or remove rows — only the ``income`` column changes — preserving the
PUMS-actual filing status mix, household structure, and demographics.

Why redistribute vs replace:
    The previous "replace with synthetic rows" approach used DOTAX $400K+
    filing-status shares (69% MFJ / 22% Single), but actual PUMS in
    $500K-$1M has ~62% MFJ / 26% MFS / 10% Single / 2.5% HoH. Because
    Hawaii MFS uses the same brackets as Single ($225K surcharge floor),
    the PUMS distribution generates ~36% surcharge-vulnerable filers vs
    the synth template's 26%. Overriding with template shares dropped
    HB 2306 surcharge revenue. Redistribution preserves the real mix.

    The mapping uses each filer's weighted percentile within the bracket as
    the Pareto quantile. Sort order is preserved (low income → low Pareto
    draw, high income → high Pareto draw), so demographics correlated with
    income (e.g. occupation, age) stay aligned with their relative position.

    Parameters
    ----------
    df : DataFrame
        Tax units with ``income`` and ``weight`` columns. ``filing_status``,
        ``hh_id``, ``num_adults`` etc. are preserved unchanged.
    pareto_alpha : float
        Pareto shape parameter; 1.5 matches IRS SOI 2022 Hawaii top-tail.

    Returns
    -------
    (DataFrame, dict)
        Updated df (copy) plus diagnostics: pre/post mean income, pre/post
        median income, filer count, and the alpha used.
