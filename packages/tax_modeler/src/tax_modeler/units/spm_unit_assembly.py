"""SPM unit assembly from PUMS persons (Census P60-280 rules).

An SPM unit is the Census Bureau's resource-sharing group for the
Supplemental Poverty Measure. Per P60-280, an SPM unit consists of:

  * **Primary SPM unit per household**: the householder + their spouse +
    unmarried partner (if any) + relatives + foster children + any
    unrelated child under age 15. This is one "_primary" unit per
    household.
  * **Unrelated adults**: each roomer/boarder/housemate or other
    non-relative aged 15+ forms their own SPM unit.
  * **Group quarters residents** are excluded from SPM accounting.

PUMS RELSHIPP codes (2019+ vintage; same set the entities/graph.py
module uses):

  20  Householder
  21  Opposite-sex spouse                  22  Opposite-sex unmarried partner *
  23  Same-sex spouse                      24  Same-sex unmarried partner    *
  25  Biological son/daughter              26  Adopted son/daughter
  27  Stepson/stepdaughter                 28  Brother/sister
  29  Father/mother                        30  Grandchild
  31  Parent-in-law                        32  Son-in-law/daughter-in-law
  33  Other relative (cousin, niece, nephew, ...) — but ALSO unmarried partner in some vintages
  34  Foster child
  35  Other non-relative
  36  Institutionalized group quarters
  37  Non-institutionalized group quarters

The repo treats codes 20-30 + 33 + 34 as the primary SPM unit (this
matches the existing constants in entities/graph.py:262-266 — the
"unmarried partner" code 33 is grouped with the primary set per the
canonical Census interpretation used in this project).

This module is the **vectorized** entry point used by the poverty
pipeline. `EntityGraph._spm_units_for_household` (graph.py) is the
object-oriented variant; both produce the same partitioning.
