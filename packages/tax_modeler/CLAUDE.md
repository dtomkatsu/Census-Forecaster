# tax_modeler — Claude rules

## Package purpose

Hawaiʻi tax microsimulation: loads PUMS households, constructs tax units, computes federal + state tax liability, applies credits, and projects poverty impact under policy reforms.

## Key entry points

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/tax_modeler/pipeline.py` | `run_pipeline()` — top-level orchestration for revenue forecasts |
| `src/tax_modeler/poverty/impact.py` | `compute_poverty_impact()` — SPM poverty rate computation |
| `src/tax_modeler/units/constructor.py` | `TaxUnitConstructor` — builds tax units from PUMS persons |
| `src/tax_modeler/units/spm_unit_assembly.py` | `build_spm_unit_assignment()` — Census P60-280 SPM-unit assembly |
| `src/tax_modeler/poverty/spm_aggregation.py` | `aggregate_to_spm_units()` — rolls tax-unit results to SPM granularity |
| `src/tax_modeler/config/tax_system_config.py` | `TaxSystemRegistry` — bill variant registry, `compare_systems()` |

## Submodule map

| Submodule | Contents |
|-----------|---------|
| `poverty/` | SPM resource computation, thresholds, poverty impact; SPM-unit aggregation |
| `credits/` | EITC, CTC, HI-EITC, CDCC, RxKids credit calculators |
| `units/` | Tax-unit constructor, SPM-unit assembly, filing status inference |
| `liability/` | Federal + Hawaiʻi income tax calculation |
| `calibration/` | IPF weight calibration to DOTAX filer totals |
| `projection/` | Forward-year tax-unit projection (CBO/SOI/ACS-forward targets) |
| `scenarios/` | Per-bill credit overlay definitions (SB3125 CD1/CD2, HB2306) |
| `loaders/` | PUMS data loader, CEX statistical matching, benefit imputation |

## Critical architectural rule

**Revenue forecasts stay tax-unit-grained. Only the poverty-impact pipeline uses SPM-unit aggregation.** Tax credits are correctly computed at tax-unit granularity (returns are filed per tax unit). SPM aggregation is applied only in `scripts/poverty_impact_report.py` after all credit math is done.

## Test markers

```bash
# Fast, no external data (always run)
pytest tests/ -m smoke

# Requires ~83 MB DOTAX SOI tables
pytest tests/ -m requires_dotax_raw

# Requires ~639 MB IRS national SOI files
pytest tests/ -m requires_irs_external
```

## Do not touch without reading first

- `calibration/ipf_orchestrator.py` — complex multi-margin IPF; calibrated weights hit DOTAX filer counts
- `projection/income_forecast.py` — CBO/BLS-anchored forward projection; φ parameters are empirically calibrated
