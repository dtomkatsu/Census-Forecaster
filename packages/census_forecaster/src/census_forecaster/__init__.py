"""Census Forecaster — forecast current-period values from older ACS / BLS data.

Two parallel forecasting surfaces:

* `census_forecaster.acs` — project ACS estimates (annual cadence, 1y/5y
  vintages) forward to a target year, with full MOE → SE → CI propagation.
* `census_forecaster.bls` — project BLS time series (typically monthly /
  bimonthly CPI) forward to a target month, with calibrated 90% CIs.

Quick start (ACS):
    >>> from census_forecaster import AcsObservation, project_acs_ensemble
    >>> obs = [
    ...     AcsObservation(estimate=63488, moe=812, year=2018, vintage="5y",
    ...                    geoid="15003", indicator="B19013_001E"),
    ...     # ... more observations
    ... ]
    >>> forecast = project_acs_ensemble(obs, target_year=2026)
    >>> forecast.point, forecast.ci90_low, forecast.ci90_high

`project_acs_ensemble` is the production path (`project_ensemble_multi`):
multi-source macro anchors, v3 stratified bias/κ calibration, and the
split-conformal floor, with the bundled calibration payload auto-loaded.
The pre-calibration trend-only path survives as
`census_forecaster.acs.ensemble.project_ensemble` for callers that need
the uncorrected two-model ensemble (back-test baselines, ablations).

Quick start (BLS CPI):
    >>> from datetime import date
    >>> from census_forecaster.bls import (
    ...     fetch_cpi_data, project_forward_full,
    ... )
    >>> data = fetch_cpi_data(["CUURS49ASA0"], 2018, 2026)
    >>> proj = project_forward_full(data["CUURS49ASA0"], date(2026, 4, 1))
    >>> proj.value, proj.cap_fired, proj.forecast_se_log
