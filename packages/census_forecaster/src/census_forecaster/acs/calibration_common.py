"""Shared calibration primitives used by both ACS and BLS calibration.

Both calibration generators (ACS dollar-space and BLS log-space) need:

1. A bisection algorithm that finds a multiplicative SE-rescale factor
   bringing empirical CI coverage into a target band [low, high].
2. A geometric bias clamping rule (clip per-cell `mean(log(point/actual))`
   to ±log(1.10) and gate at `n >= n_threshold`).

The geometry of CI rescaling differs between the two calibration paths
— ACS rescales `(point - ci90_low)` directly (dollar-space symmetric),
BLS rescales `forecast_se_log` then exponentiates (log-space symmetric)
— so the *coverage function* itself stays in each module. What we share
here is the bisection algorithm parameterized over a `coverage_fn:
Callable[[float], float]`.

Putting this in `acs/calibration_common.py` keeps the import graph
acyclic: BLS imports it from here; ACS imports it from here; neither
imports the other. The placement under `acs/` is historical (the ACS
v3 layer was first); a future refactor could lift it to a top-level
`calibration_common.py` if more modules need it.

    """Bisect on the SE multiplicative factor to land coverage in band.

    `coverage_fn` is a pure function from factor (float) to empirical
    coverage (float in [0, 1] or NaN if no folds). The function must
    be monotonic-increasing in `factor` — larger factor widens CIs
    and increases coverage. Both ACS and BLS coverage functions satisfy
    this by construction.

    Returns `(factor, achieved_coverage)`. Behavior:

    * If coverage at factor=1.0 is already in `[target_low, target_high]`,
      returns `(1.0, cov0)` unchanged.
    * If undercover, searches `[1.0, widen_upper]` (default 5×).
    * If overcover, searches `[narrow_lower, 1.0]` (default 0.1×).
    * If the search bounds don't bracket the band, returns the closer
      endpoint with its achieved coverage — caller can decide whether to
      accept.

    The 5× widening cap and 10× narrowing floor are conservative: they
    cover the worst-case empirical κ values seen in our panels (~3-4×)
    without admitting pathological factors that would clearly indicate
    a degenerate cell (n too low, or the coverage curve is non-monotonic
    due to discretisation in a small-n cell).
