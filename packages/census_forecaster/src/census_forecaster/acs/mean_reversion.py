"""Mean-reversion model for county unemployment (ACS S2301).

VERDICT (2026-08-21): NULL — do not promote into the ensemble.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Walk-forward on the 90-county calibration panel (anchors 2014-2022,
h 1-5, n=2,937): RMSE 59.0% vs trend_ensemble 36.1% / ml_trend 33.4%,
losing at every horizon; a variant sweep (recency-weighted mean,
last-3-year mean, pure carry+offset) never gets within 20 points of the
incumbents. The county-level ACS S2301 print's variance is dominated by
its own idiosyncratic measurement structure, which only its own history
predicts — LAUS-state-driven designs cannot, however the reversion
target is chosen. Full table and reading: METHODOLOGY.md §"S2301
mean-reversion model — informative null". The model remains wired as
calibration Pass 2e so the null stays reproducible in the fold records.

Why this model was built
------------------------
Unemployment is mean-reverting (3% → 15% → 3% over a recession cycle),
while every trend-family member in this package assumes continuity.
METHODOLOGY.md has documented since April 2026 that S2301's chronic
miscalibration (trend MAPE ≈ 36–40%, raw CI90 coverage ≈ 75–77%, κ
pinned at the 2.60 ceiling) is model misspecification, and prescribes
"a dedicated mean-reversion model (AR(1) toward a long-run mean)".
This module is that model.

Model
-----
Let ``u_t`` be the county's **LAUS** annual-average unemployment rate
(administrative, county-level, far less noisy than the ACS S2301 print)
and ``a_t`` the published ACS S2301 estimate. With anchor year ``T`` and
horizon ``h``:

    point = delta_c + mu_c + phi^h_eff · (u_state − mu_c)

* ``mu_c``   — county long-run mean of LAUS over years ≤ T.
* ``phi``    — pooled AR(1) coefficient, fit by through-origin OLS of
  ``(u_{t+1} − mu_c)`` on ``(u_t − mu_c)`` across ALL counties in the
  bundled LAUS file, years ≤ T (per-county series are far too short to
  fit phi individually; unemployment dynamics are a national business-
  cycle phenomenon, so pooling is the right prior). Clamped [0, 0.95].
* ``u_state``— the latest LAUS value at year ``T − g`` (g ≥ 0 when the
  anchor year is missing); ``h_eff = h + g`` so reversion runs from the
  year the state was actually observed.
* ``delta_c``— county ACS↔LAUS offset, the mean of ``(a_t − u_t)`` over
  paired years ≤ T. ACS S2301 and LAUS measure different universes
  (household-survey share of civilian labor force vs the LAUS model),
  and the gap is systematic per county — this offset is the reason this
  model can beat the raw ``level_anchor`` (which applies LAUS with no
  offset and pays for it: RMSE ≈ 52%).

Uncertainty
-----------
    se_total² = sigma_ar² · Σ_{k=0..h_eff−1} phi^{2k}     (AR(1) h-step)
              + sigma_map² · (1 + 1/n_pairs)              (offset noise)

``sigma_map`` is the SD of the offset residuals ``(a_t − u_t − delta_c)``
— it already contains the ACS sampling noise of the target print, so the
MOE of the latest observation is deliberately NOT added again
(``se_sample = 0``; adding it would double-count). No EMPIRICAL_SE_INFLATOR
is baked in: the κ bisection calibrates whatever raw SE the fold cache
carries, and the fallback κ equals the base inflator so the uncorrected
factor is exactly 1.0.

No-peeking discipline
---------------------
All of ``mu_c``, ``phi``, ``delta_c``, ``sigma_*`` use only years ≤ the
anchor. LAUS year-Y annual averages are final by early Y+1, well before
the year-Y ACS release the backtest's publication mode keys on — the
same treatment the LAUS level anchor already receives (lag 0 in the
source registry).
