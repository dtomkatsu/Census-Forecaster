"""Cross-county histogram-boosting trend forecaster.

This module is the third member of the ACS forecast ensemble. The first
two — ``project_damped_trend`` and ``project_ar1_log_diff`` in
``projection.py`` — operate on a single (geoid, indicator) series in
isolation and so cannot exploit cross-county or cross-indicator signal.
The model here pools all 147 counties × 16 indicators into a single
training panel and lets a histogram-based gradient-boosting tree learn
patterns the classical models can't see.

Why histogram boosting (and not LightGBM directly)
--------------------------------------------------
sklearn's ``HistGradientBoostingRegressor`` is the same algorithmic family
as LightGBM (histogram-binned gradient boosting with split finding on
discretised feature values). It is competitive on tabular tasks at the
sample size we have here (~5–10k training rows per indicator) while
shipping inside the existing sklearn install — no libomp/OpenMP runtime
dependency, no extra wheel to vendor, no platform-specific build issues.
LightGBM-via-pip on macOS requires a separate libomp install, which is a
fragile assumption for a research package.

Walk-forward discipline
-----------------------
The model is keyed by (target_indicator, cutoff_year). At calibration
time every fold (anchor=Y, h=h) trains a fresh model with
``cutoff_year = Y`` so the training set sees only data with target
year ≤ Y. The trained models are cached so a single calibration pass
reuses them across (geoid, h) folds at the same anchor. At production
time ``cutoff_year`` is the most recent observed year and the model
trains once on everything available.

SE estimation
-------------
The model's residuals are computed in log-growth space (the target the
tree fits). Residual variance is estimated per-horizon-bucket on the
training residuals and converted to dollar-space SE via the delta method
``σ_y ≈ σ_logy × y``, the same convention used by the classical models.
The ``EMPIRICAL_SE_INFLATOR`` is applied so the resulting CI matches the
diagnostic conventions of the existing ensemble; the v3 stratified κ
calibration then refines it per (indicator, pop_bucket, h_bucket) just
like for the trend / anchor methods.
