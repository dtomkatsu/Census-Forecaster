"""Anchor source loaders and registry.

A "source" wraps a JSON file under `data/anchors/` and exposes:

* `load_series(end_year)` → ordered list of (year, value) limited to
  observations whose *publication year* is ≤ end_year (so back-tests
  using a hidden-data anchor year T can never accidentally peek at
  values that hadn't been published yet).
* `annual_log_rates(end_year)` → list of (year, log_rate, weight) where
  log_rate is the YoY log-difference and weight is the recency-weighted
  smoother weight used in `projection._recency_weighted_initial_trend`.
* `smoothed_annual_rate(end_year)` → the recency-weighted geometric
  mean of YoY log rates as the forward-anchor for compound projection.

The "publication year" handling is the key difference from a naive
"slice the dict at year T" — see `publication_lag_years` per source.
For example HUD FMR FY2024 was *published* in mid-2023 based on 2021
ACS data; if we're back-testing as of anchor year 2021, we cannot use
the FY2024 FMR (it didn't exist yet). The lag accounts for this.

The loaders carry no internal state and are safe to call concurrently;
the JSON files themselves are read once per call (small, <2KB each).
