"""Stratification primitives for the v3 calibration layer.

The v2 calibration uses one global `EMPIRICAL_SE_INFLATOR=1.30` plus a
sparse `(indicator, method) → kappa` override table. v3 extends this
with two additional dimensions:

* **Population bucket** — derived from each county's 2020 ACS population
  (B01003_001E). Frozen for the lifetime of the calibration vintage, so
  bucket assignments don't drift between calibration runs. Boundaries
  are intentionally coarse (4 levels) to keep cells statistically
  reliable on a ~150-county panel.

* **Horizon bucket** — short (h ∈ {1, 2}) vs long (h ∈ {3, 4, 5}). A
  3-bucket scheme (medium = h{3, 4}) was considered but fragments the
  small-population cells below n≈30 once the suspended 2020 1-year ACS
  is accounted for. 2-bucket retains statistical power without losing
  the dominant horizon-coverage signal (κ at long horizon is materially
  larger than κ at short).

The classifier functions and the indexed-lookup primitive in this module
are pure — no I/O, no model dependencies. The calibration generator
emits `StrataRecord` lists which are then indexed by `index_records()`
into a dict supporting the documented fallback chain:

    (indicator, method, pop, h)  → exact cell with n ≥ n_threshold
    (indicator, method, pop, *)  → marginalised over h
    (indicator, method, *,   *)  → marginalised over both
    sentinel floor               → returned when no record qualifies

The "*" sentinel marks pre-aggregated records produced by the
calibration generator (NOT computed at lookup time). This keeps lookups
O(1) and avoids re-aggregation cost on every projection call.

    The returned callable signature is::

        lookup(indicator, method, pop_bucket, h_bucket) -> (StrataRecord, source)

    Where `source` is one of:

    * "exact"   — exact (indicator, method, pop, h) record with n ≥ threshold.
    * "h_marg"  — h-marginalised (indicator, method, pop, "*") with n ≥ threshold.
    * "global"  — fully marginalised (indicator, method, "*", "*") with n ≥ threshold.

    ----------

    n_threshold : int

        Records below this are silently skipped at every level — the
        chain falls through to the next.
    floor_value : float
        Value to return when no qualifying record exists. For κ this is
        typically `EMPIRICAL_SE_INFLATOR` (1.30); for bias it is 0.0

    Records with `n_folds < n_threshold` are *kept* in the index but
