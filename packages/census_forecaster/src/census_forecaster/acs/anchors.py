"""Multi-source macro-anchor ensemble.

Replaces the legacy fixed-weight (0.30 to a single CPI rate) macro
blend with a weighted ensemble across all sources admissible for the
indicator under projection.

How weights are determined
--------------------------
For each `(indicator, anchor_source)` pair we compute the historical
RMSE of the source's smoothed YoY log-rate as an estimator of the
*subsequent* ACS YoY change at the same horizon. Sources that closely
track ACS get higher weight; sources that are noisy or biased get
lower. Weights are inverse-variance:

        w_i ∝ 1 / (RMSE_i² + σ_floor²)

with `σ_floor` preventing a single near-perfect source from monopolising
the weight (which would defeat the diversification benefit).

Calibration data
----------------
Per-(indicator, source) RMSE is precomputed by
`scripts/calibrate_anchors.py` and stored in
`data/anchors/calibration.json`. If the calibration file is missing
(first run), the loader falls back to equal weights and emits a
warning. The production `project_acs_2026.py` script always runs
calibration first and writes the file.

Hidden-data discipline
----------------------
The calibration uses only data that would have been visible at each
back-test anchor year T, via `AnchorSource.publication_lag_years`. The
production projection at run time T_now uses *current* visible data;
we explicitly do NOT condition the weights on the projection target.
That would constitute leak-back of out-of-sample information.
