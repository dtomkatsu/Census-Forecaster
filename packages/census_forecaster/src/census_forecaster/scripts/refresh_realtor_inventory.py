"""Refresh Realtor.com county listing-market metrics for Hawaii.

Why this source
---------------
Every housing series already in the panel measures the **sale** side —
DBEDT resale counts and median prices, Zillow's ZHVI valuation index,
FRED permit units. All of them are recorded at or after closing, which
in Hawaii lands 30-60 days after the price was actually agreed.

Realtor.com's Residential Listings database measures the **listing**
side: how long homes sit, how many sellers cut their asking price, how
much is for sale, how much is under contract. Those move while a deal
is being negotiated rather than after it settles, which is the whole
point of adding them — they are candidate *leading* indicators for
``HONOLULU_ZHVI``, not another way of measuring the same closings.

Coverage: 4 Hawaii counties, monthly, 2016-07 → current month (~1-month
lag; the file was refreshed 2026-08-04 with 2026-07 data as of writing,
making it the freshest housing series in the panel). Keyless.

Kalawao County (15005) is absent from the source — population ~80, no
listing market to speak of. The other four counties are complete: 121/121
months on every metric taken here, verified 2026-08-06.

NOT Redfin
----------
Redfin's Data Center county tracker was the first choice: it reaches back
to 2012 (vs 2016 here) and carries genuine sale-side extras this file has
no equivalent of — ``months_of_supply`` and ``avg_sale_to_list``. It was
rejected because **it is frozen**. Every export in that bucket (national,
metro, county, state, zip) carries an identical ``Last-Modified`` of
2026-06-02, with data stopping at 2026-05 — no update in over two months,
checked 2026-08-06. A feed that has stopped advancing cannot serve the
nowcast role this intake exists for. Its Honolulu single-family sale
counts do agree with DBEDT's to within ~2% where they overlap, so it
remains a sound archival cross-check if anyone ever wants the 2012-2016
backfill; it is simply not worth a 241 MB monthly download to re-fetch a
series that no longer moves.

``quality_flag``
----------------
The source marks some months as lower-confidence (thin volume, or
pandemic-era disruption — for Honolulu the flagged months cluster from
2020-03). Those rows are kept, not dropped: silently removing months
would change the series composition in a way no downstream consumer
could audit, and the screen already re-runs itself with 2020 excluded.
The flag is recorded in the limitations note instead.
