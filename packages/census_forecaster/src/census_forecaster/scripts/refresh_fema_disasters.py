"""Refresh FEMA major-disaster declarations for Hawaii.

This is NOT a predictor. Nothing here is screened against anything —
it is a **control**, the same kind of thing ``exclude_2020`` already is.

The screen re-runs itself with 2020 removed because one shock moved
every series at once, manufacturing correlations that are really a
single event seen many times. Hawaii has smaller versions of that shock
on a regular cadence: the 2023 Lahaina wildfire, the 2018 Kīlauea
eruption, Hurricane Lane, repeated flood declarations. Each one moves
arrivals, payrolls and prices together for a few months. Having the
dates in the repo makes it possible to ask whether a finding survives
their removal, instead of hoping it does.

Two design decisions that matter more than they look:

**Biological declarations are dropped by default.** Hawaii's COVID
declaration (DR-4510) has an incident window of 2020-01-20 →
2023-05-11 — 41 months. Excluding every declared month would delete
three and a half years of panel, which is not a robustness check, it is
demolition. The 2020 gate already handles that regime.

**Long incident windows are capped** (``MAX_SPAN_MONTHS``). A
declaration's window is an administrative artifact as much as a
physical one: DR-4201 (Puʻu ʻŌʻō) runs 2014-09 → 2015-03 because lava
kept advancing, but the economic shock is concentrated at the start.
Capping keeps a single long declaration from quietly dominating the
excluded set. Both defaults are arguments, not hardcoded.
