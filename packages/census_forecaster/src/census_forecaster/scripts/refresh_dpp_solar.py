"""Fetch Honolulu DPP solar permit aggregates and write them to bundled disk.

Source: City & County of Honolulu open-data portal (Socrata), dataset
``4vab-c87q`` — "Building Permits" master table, 1999→present, refreshed
by DPP. Queries are server-side SoQL aggregations (a few KB transferred),
keyless and anonymous.

Why this exists: the SB 3125 REEC forecast projects residential
renewable-energy credit demand as ``base_2023 × income_growth ×
demand_factor``, where the demand factors are *scenario assumptions*
derived from SEIA national forecasts. DPP solar permits are the physical
Oʻahu counterpart — an empirical check on those assumptions that still
beats the ~2-year DOTAX claim lag, though not by as much as the portal's
update cadence suggests: as of the 2026-07 fetch the dataset was updated
days earlier yet its content window still ends 2025-06-30, i.e. the
observed *publication lag is ~12 months*, not ~1.

Flag choice (verified against the portal 2026-07-30):

* ``solar = 'Y'`` — the maintained flag; ~6-7k residential permits/yr
  recently. Includes solar water heating, which §235-12.5 also credits,
  so it matches the REEC base *better* than a PV-only flag.
* ``solarvpinstallation = 'Y'`` — appears abandoned after ~2017 (the
  portal's dedicated "PV permits" dataset also ends June 2017); carried
  as a secondary column for the historical PV boom shape only.
